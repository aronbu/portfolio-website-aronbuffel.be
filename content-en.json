      "Good day, my name is Aron Buffel. I am currently a student at Howest in Bruges, where I am studying TI Software Engineering. Programming has always been a passion of mine and I have gained a lot of experience with different programming languages and technologies over the past few years.",
      "During my studies, I have worked on many different projects, both in front-end and back-end development. I enjoy solving challenging problems and designing beautiful, functional interfaces. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for the front-end and with Java, C#, NodeJS and Python for the back-end.",
      "My interest in both front-end and back-end development has led me to focus on a position as a Full-stack developer. I believe my knowledge and skills will position me well for this role and I look forward to continuing to develop and expand my skills.",
      "Besides my studies and my interest in programming, I enjoy fitness, course cycling and traveling. I am an enthusiastic and driven person who is always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow."

The trip really began with a 6-hour bus ride to Paris airport, where we then had to take our 12-hour flight to San Francisco. When we landed in San Francisco after 12 hours, it was still morning of the same day even though many hours had passed—jet lag is strange.",

On this tour we used the typical “cable cars” for the first time. It’s something quite unique; being one of their operators seems like a tough job to me. We also walked through quintessential San Francisco spots with steep hills and beautiful views. The walk eventually led to one of the many piers, “Pier 39,” a pier with lots of restaurants and entertainment. Next to the pier there is also a place where sea lions gather."
